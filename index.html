<!-- 
	I wonder what you've come here to see.
	Don't take it too personal, I am a better developer than you are!

	A WARNING
	=========
	IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, THIS IS THE TIME TO GO BACK.
	YES DO IT, CLICK ON THAT BACK BUTTON. THE JOURNEY AHEAD IS NOT FOR HUMANS LIKE YOU.
	
	A BETTER, CLEARER WARNING FOR A CURIOUSLY STUPID YOU
	====================================================
	UNLESS YOU ARE SURE YOU HAVE BEEN INITIATED, NO THINKING, NO GUESSING, YOU HAVE TO
	BE SURE: DO NOT CONTINUE READING ANYTHING, WHATSOEVER ON THIS PAGE. Be wary, when I warn
	People get scared.

	Anyway, here are a few things you should know. You know, to help you not waste your time.
	1. This is not a website, I mean it, do not think this is some combination of html and css 
	 	that you can look at and make jokes of because it is not.

	2. 	I have only minified core stylesheets and scripts that affected speed. Nothing more. I've
		got nothing to hide, especially when I'm sure you're fooling around, thinking you know what
		it takes to develop a software, whoever the fuck you are.

	3. You will not find the markup for anything except the index page which obviously, is exactly what you
	 	are currently looking at. Remember it is not a website. But if you really want to see any of the markups
	 	at all, use ctrl+shift+i on your miserable browser (I hope it's chrome anyway, unless it is even more 
	 	miserable than I'm thinking right now), and check out the inspect elements tab.
	 	Spoiler Alert: They are all auto-generated markups. So, still, you are practically stalking my code.
	 	You know what happens to stalkers? they keep stalking until they are called out. And then they commit
	 	suicide.

	 	Go pick up some Introduction to BASIC or try learning some logic building (my favorite subject till date).
	 	I hope you know what those are anyway.

	 	GOOD LUCK FINDING WHAT YOU CAME FOR INCASE YOU STILL THINK YOU CAN DEVELOP SOFTWARES. LOL, I bet you've only
	 	written some school software for some broke school and got paid some meager cash and answered web-related questions
	 	on some berateful community site and then ended up updating your fucked up resume. You're a typical case of the Dunning-Kruger effect
	 	You should go donate yourself to some psychologist.

	 	NB: Incase you need to reply: I'm available at samueladeshina73 dot gmail dot com. I'd appreciate if your subject is:

	 		IT's ME AGAIN, THE FOOL.

	 		You know, I deal with a lot of guys like you. My SPAM box is already been harvested for data that could help study
	 		you guys psychology, to see if any help is out there in the galaxy waiting to be exploited for you guys. 


	 		Also, there's this site called stackoverflow, I thought I shouldn't leave you with the despair of not knowing
	 		what that is also. It is a community of over 6.4 million professional programmers, unlike you, helping each other.
	 		Join them, it only takes minute. Hope you know how to do a google search? Find their site. StackOverflow.
